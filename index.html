                    <p class="places__text">Kyiv (or Kiev), Ukraine's capital, is a large city located on the shores of
                        the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river, unless they
                        grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are hot here, and
                        the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely amazing.</p>
                    <p class="places__text">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                        architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of the
                        Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing heels. The
                        left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by people who live on
                        the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                        that juts out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                        century. Some 900 years later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has
                        become a popular tourist destination during the summer months.</p>
                    <p class="places__text">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the world's best
                        ice cream at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed.
                        Another claim to fame is the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a
                        row for its spectacular floral displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the
                        only Welshman ever to hold the office of Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                    <p class="places__text">Berea is a small town located in the central part of Kentucky. The town is
                        surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts capital of
                        the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with handmade jewelry,
                        candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a yearly festival
                        celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a wooden spoon.</p>
                    <p class="places__text">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea College was
                        founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially integrated, as well as the
                        first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no tuition — every student receives a
                        full-tuition scholarship.</p>

                        was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape, it was added
                        to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of Burundi, between the
                        country's political and economic capitals.</p>

                        you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the coldest
                        places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest plantations of tea
                        and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.</p>

                        It is filled with beautiful vegetation, and a source for the various rivers and streams which

                        area of 640.72 km2. The elevation is 583 m. This place name comes from the Tupi language,
                        meaning big waterfall. Two rivers flow through Itu: Tietê and Jundiaí. Itu was founded in 1610.
                        In 1657, it was elevated to a town and municipality. It became a city in 1843.</p>

                        moderately cold and dry. It is located between the crystalline plateau and sedimentary areas.
