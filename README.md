# Project 3: From Homeland to Homeland #
  
## Intro ##
  
This is a project that introduces the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees and one student, in this case, myself.
In this third project we get to use a design app called Figma which allows us to navigate through different designs for different resolutions and work whit other devs and, of course, designers.
Different resolutions and screen responsiveness was one of the main topics of this sprint. With so many different devices out there and the world getting more and more digital this is a crucial skill to have as a webdeveloper/software enginner.


## Technologies ##

In this project we used the following apps/softwares:
* VsCode > HTHML, CSS;
* Figma;
